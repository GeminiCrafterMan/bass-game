--== WEAPONS AND MODULES? ==--
When defeated, Robot Masters give Bass a WEAPON and a MODULE

WEAPON: Special Weapons are weapons that have limited ammunition but are more powerful than your regular buster.

MODULE: An item that gives you passive boosts, such as a double jump or shadow dash.

You can use either a boss's weapon or their module, but not both. You can switch them out from the stage select.

--== BLAZE MAN ==--

(Weapon) Scorch Barrier
A shield much like Water Shield that incinerates enemies and projectiles alike. You can release the attack to fly forward at enemies in a spiraling attack. It burns wood, incinerates trash, and melts any ice you touch while using it. It's only drawback is that it generates very slowly. The particles act like Junk shields, being trailed clusters

An upwards dash that kinda works as a super double jump and hurts enemies directly below you by sending flames from bass's legs downwards.
